# hello-world
Hey, I'am a Senior in the College of Computing and Software Engineering at Kennesaw State University, pursuing a major in Information Technology with a concentration in enterprise systems. I am currently looking for an internship in this area. My first experience working with computers and network systems was when I worked at an internet cafe in Nairobi, Kenya, for several years. After my time at the internet cafe, I spent several years working in the culinary industry both abroad and here in the United States. Four years ago I decided to go back to college to further develop my technology skills and pursue a career in Information Technology. At school I have learnt different programming languages like java, python, html, css, JavaScript, ajax and PHP.
